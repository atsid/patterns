# patterns
ATS Patterns is here to help document how ATS writes proposals, sends reports, formats resumes, basically any and all office publications we want to prepare for client viewing.

We want everyone at ATS to contribute to the discussion about how we communicate business ideas! I'm borrowing heavily from the Engineer Guides, so Thank You to Travis, Evan et all for writing this out once already.

    Please fork the repo or create a branch, make changes, and submit a pull request to get your ideas reviewed by other developers.

This is a Bootstrap site, so it is both readable and editable using Markdown, and is deployable straight to GitHub Pages.

Once you've made all the edits you'd like, push your branch and submit a pull request. Once your pull request has been reviewed and discussed by the team, you should get a :shipit: or two indicating that it's ready to go. At that point, merge the branch into master, and the Travis build will automatically re-deploy the site to gh-pages.

The 'patterns' are individual pages that describe some aspect of how we deliver documents and services to our customers.
